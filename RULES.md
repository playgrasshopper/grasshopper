# The rules of Grasshopper

Run between two tripods made of sticks more times than your friends!

Play starts with the Roly Poly rolling a soccer ball to the Bashbish. Before the ball is kicked the Bashbish must throw a frisbee as far as possible in any direction. The Bashbish then kicks the ball as far as possible in any direction. Once these objects have been dispatched... run! The Bashbish runs as fast as possible between the tripods until the Fielders are able to assemble all the objects at one tripod. This completes one Hop. Now the Roly Poly is the new Bashbish, and a Fielder becomes the new Roly Poly. A round consists of one Hop per player. Typical games are played to 3 rounds, the player with the most points wins!!

## Positions

- **Roly Poly** - Rolls the soccer ball to the batsman. Play starts when the Roly Poly begins to approach the batsman.
- **Bashbish** - This is the only player on offense. The Bashbish makes the first throw of the frisbee and kicks the soccer ball. Also summons magic.
- **Fielders** - These players retrieve the soccer ball(s) and frisbee. Their goal is to return all items to the same tripod. The Roly Poly becomes a Fielder immediately upon rolling the soccer ball.
- **Dogs** - Occasionally get in the way. This is fine.

## The field

The game is focused around two tripods made of sticks set up 15 paces apart. Between the two tripods there is the Throw Line. The Roly Poly must release the soccer before reaching the Throw Line. The Throw Line is located 10 paces away from the Bashbish's tripod.

A diagram of the various portions of the field is below.

## Scoring

## Magic

Players who are playing their _first game_ of Grasshopper all start with two magic spells. These spells may be called at any time while the player is the bashbish, after the ball is kicked, and before they are out.

When players wake up the next morning, whomever has the highest score has only _one_ magic spell, while the lowest-scoring player has _three_ magic spells.

### Magic spells

The following magic incantations can be cast at any point during play by the bashbish:

- **Beetlejuice, beetlejuice, beetlejuice, [other player's name]** - After calling "Beetlejuice" thrice, the bashbish names an opponent. That opponent then tries their hardest to _prevent_ a ball or frisbee from reaching a tripod. The "juiced" player may knock down balls, slap frisbees, or otherwise confuse the other players, but may not kick the ball or throw the frisbee.
- **Grapevine** - All players who are not the bashbish may only move by doing a grapevine dance (passing the feet side to side, one in front of the other)
- **Multiball** - The bashbish, upon reaching the opposite tripod, can pick up the extra soccer ball and kick it in any direction. That ball is now required to reach the same tripod as the main soccer ball and frisbee before the batter is considered out.
